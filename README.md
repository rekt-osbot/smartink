## 🎯 **Trading Philosophy**

### **SmartInk vs Traditional Stock Screeners**

| Feature | Traditional Screeners | SmartInk |
|---------|----------------------|----------|
| **Focus** | All stocks above SMA | Actionable opportunities only |
| **Entry Timing** | Often too late (8-10% extended) | Early identification (±5% of SMA) |
| **Risk Management** | Shows extended moves | Filters out high-risk entries |
| **Signal Quality** | Mixed signals | Fresh breakouts prioritized |
| **Trading Edge** | Reactive | Proactive |

### **❌ What We DON'T Show (Avoid These)**
- Stocks already 8-10% above SMA (too late to enter)
- Extended momentum plays (high risk)
- Chasing moves that already happened

### **✅ What We DO Show (Actionable Opportunities)**
- **Fresh Breakouts**: Stocks breaking above SMA today (BUY signals)
- **Near SMA Setups**: Stocks within ±5% of SMA (watch for breakouts)
- **Early Identification**: Catch moves before they become extended
- **Lower Risk Entries**: Better risk/reward ratios

## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q: How often should I refresh the data?**
A: For day trading, refresh 2-3 times per day. For swing trading, once daily is sufficient.

### **Q: What's the difference between "Fresh Breakout" and "Holding Above"?**
A: "Fresh Breakout" means the stock broke above SMA TODAY (immediate action signal). "Holding Above" means it's been above SMA and maintaining (monitor for continuation).

### **Q: Why focus on ±5% of SMA instead of all stocks above SMA?**
A: Stocks already 8-10% above SMA are extended and risky to enter. The ±5% range catches opportunities before they become overextended.

### **Q: Can I use this for other markets besides NSE?**
A: Currently optimized for NSE stocks, but the logic can be adapted for other markets supported by yfinance.

### **Q: How accurate are the breakout signals?**
A: This is a screening tool, not a prediction system. Always combine with your own analysis, risk management, and market context.
